## Final Project

Hello, Welcome to my Final Project!

This is a project I made working with markdown and GitHub. There was also other IT-related concepts and knowledge that helped in creating this website. 

**Warning!**

This project may or may not be viewable to some views due to _perfection_. View discretion is advised.

This is my [home page!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page) (<--- click here if you don't know what that means).

More of the site's content can be seen below.

* Paragraphs.
* Headers.
* Links between the markdown pages.
* Links to other web sites.
* One or more images that are hosted in the GitHub repo.
* One or more images that are hosted elsewhere on the web.
* A list.
* Some text that is **bolded**.
* Some text that is _italicized_.
* A block of code.
