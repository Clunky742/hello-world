At the moment the game _New World_ is taking over everyone's current status. Amazon did a pretty good job but the game is graphics intensive. 
>7/10

Another personal favorite is Rocket League. If you like sports and cars, rocket league is for you. Very competitive and harder than it looks. 
>8/10

Candy Crush will never be beat. I could play it for hours. Endless levels = endless joy.
